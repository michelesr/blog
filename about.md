I always been enthusiast about technology and *IT*, since I was a child. But my
immersion into *Computer Science* began when I started to explore the beautiful world
of *FLOSS* and *GNU/Linux*.

Then I decided to join the *Applied Computer Science* course at *University of
Urbino*, and I graduated in 2015, with a
[thesis](https://michelesr.github.io/thesis/dist/thesis.pdf) regarding the
development of application in container based environments.

After the graduation, I had the opportunity to work for the *University of Urbino*
as *DevOps Engineer* in the [*SmartRoadSense*](http://smartroadsense.it/blog/en)
project, when I assisted (together with my colleague *Antonio Esposito*) to the
migration of the application from a legacy to a container based environment and
then to an instance of *OpenShift Origin* that we managed to install in a private
*Atomic CentOS* cluster.

During 2016 I also been engaged in other freelance collaborations, including a
role as *Odoo developer* and other roles when I managed development and deploy of
web applications (mainly based on *Django Web Framework*), using *Ansible* as
Configuration Management tool.

I'm planning to move to London at the end of 2016, to find new exciting
experencies. I'm also looking for a job there, so feel free to contact me!
