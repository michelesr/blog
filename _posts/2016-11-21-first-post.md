So, I finally decided to set up my personal blog, mostly because I want to store
and share my experiences with the world with the hope that they will be useful
to someone.

I'm not a man of words and for sure I don't want to bore anyone, so I'll try to
adopt the "Less is Better" philosophy.

Articles will start to appear soon, so stay tuned, and have a good day!
